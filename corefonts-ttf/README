This directory contains the original CAB files (.exe) and the cabextract executable rpm for Linux. I've left it all here for the curious (and clinically insane).

For convenience I've created the mscorettf.tar file which contains all the previously extracted .TTF files, so you don't need to bother with the insanity.

To install:

1. Extract the mscorettf.tar file into the jre/lib/fonts/ directory.
