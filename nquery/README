Summary
---------------------------------------
nQuery is a Perl CGI application that presents an HTTP-RPC set of functions
for querying data from the Nagios configuration files.

The first incarnation will have canned functions for returning lists of 
hosts based on various criteria (all hosts, all hosts for a cust, 
lab hosts, lab hosts for a cust, etc). 

The application is meant to reside on the Nagios server box in order
to have direct access to the objects.cache file. For our installs at
Tomax, this file is found at the following path:

    /u01/app/nagios/var/objects.cache



API
---------------------------------------
The following functions are provided:

http://server/nquery/listcusts

    o Return list of all cust IDs.

    o Data comes from the "hostgroup_name" field of the top-level 
      "hostgroup" rec.
      eg.

      define hostgroup {
          hostgroup_name  atg
          alias   ATG
          members v19u19,v19u05,v19u11,v19u6,v19u4,v19u3
          }



http://server/nquery/listhosts

    o No query string.

    o Return a text list of all hosts.

	o Data comes from the "members" field of the top-level
      "hostgroup" rec.
	


http://server/nquery/listhosts?cust={custid}
    o  {custid} is the Nagios customer ID
